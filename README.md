# rodauth-rails

Provides Rails integration for the [Rodauth] authentication framework.

## Resources

* [Rodauth documentation](http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/documentation.html)
* [rodauth-rails wiki](https://github.com/janko/rodauth-rails/wiki)
* [Rails demo](https://github.com/janko/rodauth-demo-rails)

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```rb
gem "rodauth-rails", "~> 0.1"
```

Then run `bundle install`.

Next, run the install generator:

```
$ rails generate rodauth:install
```

The generator will create the following files:

* Rodauth migration at `db/migrate/*_create_rodauth.rb`
* Rodauth initializer at `config/initializers/rodauth.rb`
* Sequel initializer at `config/initializers/sequel.rb` for ActiveRecord integration
* Rodauth app at `lib/rodauth_app.rb`
* Rodauth controller at `app/controllers/rodauth_controller.rb`
* Account model at `app/models/account.rb`

### Migration

The migration file creates tables required by Rodauth. You're encouraged to
review the migration, and modify it to only create tables for features you
intend to use.

```rb
# db/migrate/*_create_rodauth.rb
class CreateRodauth < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :accounts do |t| ... end
    create_table :account_password_hashes do |t| ... end
    create_table :account_password_reset_keys do |t| ... end
    create_table :account_verification_keys do |t| ... end
    create_table :account_login_change_keys do |t| ... end
    create_table :account_remember_keys do |t| ... end
    # ...
  end
end
```

Once you're done, you can run the migration:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

### Rodauth initializer

The Rodauth initializer assigns the constant for your Rodauth app, which will
be called by the Rack middleware that's added in front of your Rails router.

```rb
# config/initializers/rodauth.rb
Rodauth::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.app = "RodauthApp"
end
```

### Sequel initializer

Rodauth uses [Sequel] for database interaction. If you're using ActiveRecord,
an additional initializer will be created which configures Sequel to use the
ActiveRecord connection.

```rb
# config/initializers/sequel.rb
require "sequel/core"

# initialize the appropriate Sequel adapter without creating a connection
DB = Sequel.postgres(test: false)
# have Sequel use ActiveRecord's connection for database interaction
DB.extension :activerecord_connection
```

### Rodauth app

Your Rodauth app is created in the `lib/` directory, which comes with a default
set of authentication features enabled, as well as extensive examples on ways
you can configure authentication behaviour.

```rb
# lib/rodauth_app.rb
class RodauthApp < Rodauth::Rails::App
  configure do
    # authentication configuration
  end

  route do |r|
    # request handling
  end
end
```

Note that Rails doesn't autoload files in the `lib/` directory by default, so
make sure to add `lib/` to your `config.autoload_paths`:

```rb
# config/application.rb
module YourApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...
    config.autoload_paths += %W[#{config.root}/lib]
  end
end
```

### Controller

Your Rodauth app will by default use `RodauthController` for view rendering
and CSRF protection.

```rb
# app/controllers/rodauth_controller.rb
class RodauthController < ApplicationController
end
```

### Account Model

Rodauth stores user accounts in the `accounts` table, so the generator will
also create an `Account` model for custom use.

```rb
# app/models/account.rb
class Account < ApplicationRecord
end
```

## Getting started

Let's start by adding some basic authentication navigation links to our home
page:

```erb
<ul>
  <% if rodauth.authenticated? %>
    <li><%= link_to "Sign out", rodauth.logout_path, method: :post %></li>
  <% else %>
    <li><%= link_to "Sign in", rodauth.login_path %></li>
    <li><%= link_to "Sign up", rodauth.create_account_path %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

These links are fully functional, feel free to visit them and interact with the
pages. The templates that ship with Rodauth aim to provide a complete
authentication experience, and the forms use [Bootstrap] markup.

Let's also add the `#current_account` method for retrieving the account of the
the authenticated session:

```rb
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  private

  def current_account
    @current_account ||= Account.find(rodauth.session_value)
  end
  helper_method :current_account
end
```
```erb
<p>Authenticated as: <%= current_account.email %></p>
```

### Requiring authentication

Next, we'll likely want to require authentication for certain sections/pages of
our app. We can do this in our Rodauth app's routing block, which helps keep
the authentication logic encapsulated:

```rb
# lib/rodauth_app.rb
class RodauthApp < Rodauth::Rails::App
  # ...
  route do |r|
    # ...
    r.rodauth # route rodauth requests

    # require authentication for /dashboard/* and /account/* routes
    if r.path.start_with?("/dashboard") || r.path.start_with?("/account")
      rodauth.require_authentication # redirect to login page if not authenticated
    end
  end
end
```

We can also require authentication at the controller layer:

```rb
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  private

  def authenticate
    rodauth.require_authentication # redirect to login page if not authenticated
  end
end
```
```rb
# app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb
class DashboardController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate
end
```
```rb
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate, except: [:index, :show]
end
```

Or at the Rails router level:

```rb
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  constraints -> (r) { r.env["rodauth"].require_authentication } do
    namespace :admin do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

### Views

The templates built into Rodauth are useful when getting started, but at some
point we'll probably want more control over the markup. For that we can run the
following command:

```sh
$ rails generate rodauth:views
```

This will generate views for the default set of Rodauth features into the
`app/views/rodauth` directory, which will be automatically picked up by the
`RodauthController`.

You can pass a list of Rodauth features to the generator to create views for
these features (this will not remove any existing views):

```sh
$ rails generate rodauth:views --features login create_account lockout otp
```

Or you can generate views for all features:

```sh
$ rails generate rodauth:views --all
```

You can also tell the generator to create views into another directory (in this
case don't forget to rename the Rodauth controller accordingly).

```sh
# generates views into app/views/authentication
$ rails generate rodauth:views --name authentication
```

#### Layout

To use different layouts for different Rodauth views, you can compare the
request path in the layout method:

```rb
class RodauthController < ApplicationController
  layout :rodauth_layout

  private

  def rodauth_layout
    case request.path
    when rodauth.login_path,
         rodauth.create_account_path,
         rodauth.verify_account_path,
         rodauth.reset_password_path,
         rodauth.reset_password_request_path
      "authentication"
    else
      "dashboard"
    end
  end
end
```

### Mailer

Rodauth may send emails as part of the authentication flow. Most email settings
can be customized:

```rb
# lib/rodauth_app.rb
class RodauthApp < Rodauth::Rails::App
  # ...
  configure do
    # ...
    # general settings
    email_from "no-reply@myapp.com"
    email_subject_prefix "[MyApp] "
    send_email(&:deliver_later)
    # ...
    # feature settings
    verify_account_email_subject "Verify your account"
    verify_account_email_body { "Verify your account by visting this link: #{verify_account_email_link}" }
    # ...
  end
end
```

This is convenient when starting out, but eventually you might want to use your
own mailer. You can start by running the following command:

```sh
$ rails generate rodauth:mailer
```

This will create a `RodauthMailer` with the associated mailer views in
`app/views/rodauth_mailer` directory.

```rb
# app/mailers/rodauth_mailer.rb
class RodauthMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def verify_account(recipient, email_link) ... end
  def reset_password(recipient, email_link) ... end
  def verify_login_change(recipient, old_login, new_login, email_link) ... end
  def password_changed(recipient) ... end
  # def email_auth(recipient, email_link) ... end
  # def unlock_account(recipient, email_link) ... end
end
```

You can then uncomment the lines in your Rodauth configuration to have it call
your mailer. If you've enabled additional authentication features, make sure to
override their `send_*_email` methods as well.

```rb
# lib/rodauth_app.rb
class RodauthApp < Rodauth::Rails::App
  # ...
  configure do
    # ...
    send_reset_password_email do
      RodauthMailer.reset_password(email_to, reset_password_email_link).deliver_now
    end
    send_verify_account_email do
      RodauthMailer.verify_account(email_to, verify_account_email_link).deliver_now
    end
    send_verify_login_change_email do |login|
      RodauthMailer.verify_login_change(login, verify_login_change_old_login, verify_login_change_new_login, verify_login_change_email_link).deliver_now
    end
    send_password_changed_email do
      RodauthMailer.password_changed(email_to).deliver_now
    end
    # send_email_auth_email do
    #   RodauthMailer.email_auth(email_to, email_auth_email_link).deliver_now
    # end
    # send_unlock_account_email do
    #   RodauthMailer.unlock_account(email_to, unlock_account_email_link).deliver_now
    # end
    # ...
  end
end
```

## How it works

### Middleware

rodauth-rails inserts a `Rodauth::Rails::Middleware` into your middleware
stack, which calls your Rodauth app for each request, before the request
reaches the Rails router.

```sh
$ rails middleware
...
use Rodauth::Rails::Middleware
run MyApp::Application.routes
```

The Rodauth app stores the `Rodauth::Auth` instance in the Rack env hash, which
is then available in your Rails app:

```rb
request.env["rodauth"] #=> #<Rodauth::Auth>
request.env["rodauth.secondary"] #=> #<Rodauth::Auth> (if using multiple configurations)
```

For convenience, this object can be accessed via the `#rodauth` method in views
and controllers:

```rb
class MyController < ApplicationController
  def my_action
    rodauth #=> #<Rodauth::Auth>
    rodauth(:secondary) #=> #<Rodauth::Auth> (if using multiple configurations)
  end
end
```
```erb
<% rodauth #=> #<Rodauth::Auth> %>
<% rodauth(:secondary) #=> #<Rodauth::Auth> (if using multiple configurations) %>
```

### App

The `Rodauth::Rails::App` class is a [Roda] subclass that provides Rails
integration for Rodauth:

* uses Rails' flash instead of Roda's
* uses Rails' CSRF protection instead of Roda's
* sets [HMAC] secret to Rails' secret key base
* uses ActionController for rendering templates
* uses ActionMailer for sending emails

The `configure { ... }` method wraps configuring the Rodauth plugin, forwarding
any additional [options].

```rb
configure { ... }             # defining default Rodauth configuration
configure(json: true)         # passing options to the Rodauth plugin
configure(:secondary) { ... } # defining multiple Rodauth configurations
```

### Sequel

Rodauth uses the [Sequel] library for database queries, due to more advanced
database usage (SQL expressions, database-agnostic date arithmetic, SQL
function calls).

If ActiveRecord is used in the application, the `rodauth:install` generator
will have automatically configured Sequel to reuse ActiveRecord's database
connection (using the [sequel-activerecord_connection] gem).

This means that, from the usage perspective, Sequel can be considered just
as an implementation detail of Rodauth.

## Configuring

For the list of configuration methods provided by Rodauth, see the [feature
documentation].

The `rails` feature rodauth-rails loads is customizable as well, here is the
list of its configuration methods:

| Name                        | Description                                                        |
| :----                       | :----------                                                        |
| `rails_render(**options)`   | Renders the template with given render options.                    |
| `rails_csrf_tag`            | Hidden field added to Rodauth templates containing the CSRF token. |
| `rails_csrf_param`          | Value of the `name` attribute for the CSRF tag.                    |
| `rails_csrf_token`          | Value of the `value` attribute for the CSRF tag.                   |
| `rails_check_csrf!`         | Verifies the authenticity token for the current request.           |
| `rails_controller_instance` | Instance of the controller with the request env context.           |
| `rails_controller`          | Controller class to use for rendering and CSRF protection.         |

The `Rodauth::Rails` module has a few config settings available as well:

| Name         | Description                                                                                         |
| :-----       | :----------                                                                                         |
| `app`        | Constant name of your Rodauth app, which is called by the middleware.                               |
| `middleware` | Whether to insert the middleware into the Rails application's middleware stack. Defaults to `true`. |

```rb
# config/initializers/rodauth.rb
Rodauth::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.app = "RodauthApp"
  config.middleware = true
end
```

## Working with JWT

To work with JWT, you'll need to enable json in `Roda`, and the [JWT plugin][Rodauth JWT documentation]


```rb
# lib/rodauth_app.rb
class RodauthApp < Rodauth::Rails::App
  configure(json: true) do
    enable :jwt
    # your configuration
  end
end
```

## Testing

If you're writing system tests, it's generally better to go through the actual
authentication flow with tools like Capybara, and to not use any stubbing.

In functional and integration tests you can just make requests to Rodauth
routes:

```rb
# test/controllers/posts_controller_test.rb
class PostsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "should require authentication" do
    get posts_url
    assert_redirected_to "/login"

    login
    get posts_url
    assert_response :success

    logout
    assert_redirected_to "/login"
  end

  private

  def login(login: "user@example.com", password: "secret")
    post "/create-account", params: {
      "login"            => login,
      "password"         => password,
      "password-confirm" => password,
    }

    post "/login", params: {
      "login"    => login,
      "password" => password,
    }
  end

  def logout
    post "/logout"
  end
end
```

## Rodauth defaults

rodauth-rails changes some of the default Rodauth settings for easier setup:

### Database functions

By default, on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server Rodauth uses
database functions to access password hashes, with the user running the
application unable to get direct access to password hashes. This reduces the
risk of an attacker being able to access password hashes and use them to attack
other sites.

While this is useful additional security, it is also more complex to set up and
to reason about, as it requires having two different database users and making
sure the correct migration is run for the correct user.

To keep with Rails' "convention over configuration" doctrine, rodauth-rails
disables the use of database functions, though you can always turn it back on.

```rb
use_database_authentication_functions? true
```

### Account statuses

The recommended [Rodauth migration] stores possible account status values in a
separate table, and creates a foreign key on the accounts table, which ensures
only a valid status value will be persisted.

Unfortunately, this doesn't work when the database is restored from the schema
file, in which case the account statuses table will be empty. This happens in
tests by default, but it's also commonly done in development.

To address this, rodauth-rails modifies the setup to store account status text
directly in the accounts table. If you're worried about invalid status values
creeping in, you may use enums instead. Alternatively, you can always go back
to the setup recommended by Rodauth.

```rb
# in the migration:
create_table :account_statuses do |t|
  t.string :name, null: false, unique: true
end
execute "INSERT INTO account_statuses (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Unverified'), (2, 'Verified'), (3, 'Closed')"

create_table :accounts do |t|
  # ...
  t.references :status, foreign_key: { to_table: :account_statuses }, null: false, default: 1
  # ...
end
```
```diff
- account_status_column :status
- account_unverified_status_value "unverified"
- account_open_status_value "verified"
- account_closed_status_value "closed"
```
